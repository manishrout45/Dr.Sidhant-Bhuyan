      <p>Back pain has become one of the most common health issues in 2025 due to long sitting hours, work-from-home setups, and poor posture habits.</p>

      <h2>1. Maintain a Healthy Posture</h2>
      <p>Most back pain cases begin with incorrect posture. Ensure your spine stays neutral whether sitting or standing. Use ergonomic chairs, support your lower back, and avoid slouching.</p>

      <h2>2. Strengthen Your Core Muscles</h2>
      <p>A strong core stabilizes your back and reduces the risk of spinal strain. Physiotherapists recommend planks, pelvic tilts, and gentle Pilates exercises.</p>

      <h2>3. Take Breaks & Move Every 45 Minutes</h2>
      <p>Prolonged sitting compresses your spine. Get up, stretch, walk, or do simple mobility exercises like spine rotations and hamstring stretches.</p>

      <h2>4. Seek Professional Physiotherapy Early</h2>
      <p>If pain persists for more than a week, visiting a physiotherapist helps prevent chronic issues. Early treatment reduces recovery time and improves long-term function.</p>
